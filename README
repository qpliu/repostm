repostm is a low-performance software transactional memory (STM) implementation
in Go, made primarily as a learning experience and an exploration into modeling
an STM implementation after version control systems such as CVS, Subversion, or
Perforce.

This STM implementation stores data as slices of bytes, which are copied out on
reads, and copied in on commits.  Hence, low-performance.  A higher-level layer
can be added to translate the byte slices to and from data structures.
